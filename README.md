# shippingstore_gui

This is a gui for a mock shipping store developed with java swing. The user add a new package, delete a package, search for a package,
add a new user, update user, and show the current stored packages and users. The user can then "Deliver a package" where a transaction is
then created. This requires that an employee type of user and at least one packag already exists in the shipping store.

How to run:
go to the same directory that contains the folder shippingstore
type "javac -d . shippingstore/*.java" then type "java shippingstore.MainApp"
